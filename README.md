# CoffLoader
It's just un implementation of in-house CoffLoader supporting CobaltStrike standard BOF.

No real README here, if you want full explanation, look at my [paper](https://otterhacker.github.io/Malware/CoffLoader.html)

The beacon.h implementation comes from the TrustedSec [repo](https://github.com/trustedsec/CS-Situational-Awareness-BOF/)
